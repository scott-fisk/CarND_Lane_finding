Overview
---

When we drive, we use our eyes to decide where to go.  The lines on the road that show us where the lanes are act as our constant reference for where to steer the vehicle.  Naturally, one of the first things we would like to do in developing a self-driving car is to automatically detect lane lines using an algorithm.

This repository highlights my ability to develop, test, and optimize solutions for advanced autonomous systems.

Each project is designed to solve real-world challenges faced in autonomous vehicle systems, utilizing languages such as Python and C++, with a focus on writing scalable, maintainable code.
